<h1>TweetSearch</h1>
===========

<h2>About</h2>
An Android application that enables a user to search twitter.
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
    <li>A user should be able to enter a search term and see a list of results.</li>
    <li>The application should only update the results list when the user instructs it to do so (i.e.,pushing a button). </li>
    <li>Once a user has executed a search, the results should persist through rotating the phone, open/closing the app, and rebooting the phone. (e.g., if the user executes a search, and then reboots the device, when they reopen the app the results should still be displayed).</li>
    <li>The UI should remain responsive at all times.</li>
</ul>
